        I'm a passionate developer focused on building clean, scalable, and
        user-friendly web applications. I enjoy solving real-world problems

      </h3>

      <p>
        I completed my graduation from MES Abasaheb Garware College and am currently
        pursuing my postgraduate degree in MSc Computer Applications (MSc CA).
        My academic journey has helped me build a strong foundation in software
        development, data structures, and system design.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have hands-on experience in full-stack development using HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, Express.js, Node.js, and MySQL. Along with this, I am
        proficient in programming languages such as C, C++, Java, and Python,
        which strengthen my problem-solving and logical thinking skills.
      </p>

      <p>
        During my undergraduate studies, I developed an Attendance Module project
        that focused on efficient data handling and system organization.
        Currently, I am working on a Placement Cell Management project,
        where I am involved in backend development and database management.
      </p>

      <p>
        Apart from technical skills, I focus on writing clean code, maintaining
        good project structure, and continuously improving my development practices.
        I believe in consistent learning, teamwork, and adapting to new technologies
        to grow both personally and professionally.
